1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
UPDATE (2016/2/13):
The return format had been changed to zero-based indices. Please read the above updated description carefully.
============
//zero based indices!!!
public class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> mp = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        
        for (int i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
            if (mp.containsKey(target-nums[i])){
                res[0] = mp.get(target-nums[i]);
                res[1] = i;
                break;
            } else {
                mp.put(nums[i], i);
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
}
